Now even the GAFAMs are waking up to it.üì¢ This week, hashtag#MarkZuckerberg announced Meta's ambition to tackle loneliness with AI-generated friends, available 24/7.üìå Read more on MSNhttps://lnkd.in/gj4wrCmdüìå Economic Times coveragehttps://lnkd.in/gZEFTD_4üìπ YouTube interviewhttps://lnkd.in/gUsVnywv‚ù§ The best cure for loneliness is still real love, from friends, family, community. You can‚Äôt buy it‚Ä¶Unfortunately, so many are desperate enough to pay for it, and criminals take advantage: the romance-scam industry now tops ‚Ç¨4 billion annually.ü§ñ The second weapon is AI, and it‚Äôs already shaping minds.We‚Äôve seen how tech, when misused, deepens disconnection.But used ethically, AI can help people reconnect, without replacing what makes us human.So yes, this announcement is both:‚úÖ Validation, we‚Äôre on the right wave.‚ö† Warning, if done wrong, it‚Äôs not just harmful; it‚Äôs criminal.üì£ Social isolation kills nearly as much as cancer.This isn‚Äôt a UX challenge. It‚Äôs a humanity issue.That‚Äôs why we created Loneliness Global Action, to raise awareness, unite sectors, and ensure this isn‚Äôt just another tech trend, but a responsible movement.üëâ We call on researchers, entrepreneurs, governments, and yes, any CEO or startup, big or small, to get this right. And why not hashtag#MarkZuckerberg himself? Without expectation, but who knows, his billions could amplify our impact on a scale far larger than just launching another AI feature.We don‚Äôt put our faith in one brand or leader, but as Winston Churchill urged us, dare, dare, dare. What matters is that every actor fights loneliness with full awareness of the human brain‚Äôs fragility, and commits to tech-for-good.We‚Äôre not here to judge. But we won‚Äôt stay silent either.‚öñ All is in the balance.hashtag#LonelinessGlobalAction hashtag#Zuckerberg hashtag#AIethics hashtag#TechForGood hashtag#FutureOfBelonging hashtag#ResponsibleAI hashtag#LonelinessInspiration for boss üòâ, Naomi Gleit & Joel Mart√≠n Kliksberg ü´∂üèªüìù P.S. I‚Äôm also building Breezy,  an AI for emotional self-introspection, not artificial companionship. I‚Äôm not against AI. I‚Äôm committed to using it with intention and integrity.",
