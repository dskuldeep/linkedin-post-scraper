These. Words.ðŸ“‰ Agents are getting droppedðŸ“‰ Workflows are being replaced overnightðŸ“‰ hashtag#BigTech is slashing teams by the thousandsðŸ“‰ hashtag#DevTeams are getting guttedðŸ“‰ hashtag#Engineers are becoming obsoleteThe Headline: You Are More Disposable Than EverAnd still, most gleefully participate in their own demise â€” ensconced in the comfort of delusion.Every day â€”  I speak with Founders / Stakeholders.And every day â€” I brush up on the latest in hashtag#tech.And the simple conclusion is:hashtag#Ai is the new Gold Rush â€” and NO ONE UNDER THE AGE OF 40 can afford to ignore or soft-pedal who and what the hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence Rush is going to trample!If youâ€™re not mastering and learning to build with Ai â€” as the late hashtag#AnthonyBourdain once said â€” \"you are destined to get plowed under, pushed aside, and paved over by the inevitable grind of history.\"As we speak, the old sales playbook is burning on the street, next to the ashes of failed companies that didn't keep up with the relentless nature of progress!Today â€” those in -aaS industries must focus on one thing:ðŸ¤– MASTERING hashtag#Ai / hashtag#Automation ðŸ¤–ðŸ‘€ Go Deep (not wide)ðŸ‘€ Spray & Pray â€” even in hashtag#B2C â€” is deadðŸ‘€ Today & Tomorrow â€” Precision WinsðŸ‘€ And \"transactionally-focused\" agents are dead men walking â€” they just don't know it yet â€” there is only ONE GAME in town, cowboy, and that game is the LONG GAMEhashtag#RTO â€” Return To Office â€” is not the solution in the way the Boomer Brigade believes it to be.What is?Simple â€” getting in people's face's and shaking their hand!(And yeah â€” it's really that simple!)Because nothing â€” not hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence nor automation â€” will replace real human connection!In-person interactions form real relationships and real relationships drive sustainable and scalable sales â€”  period.Business is conducted in coffeeshops with a conversation â€” not sitting in an uninspired, fluorescent-lit office (and we are living out the final days of that era anyhow).It's not in a hashtag#SlideDeck, or on a hashtag#ColdCall, or another hashtag#ValueDrivenDemo that fails to demonstrate value...People are engaged at events... while eating.And deals are done at dinner because decisions are never made on an empty stomach â€” people buy from those who nourish them with the trust they hunger for!Human connection is the strongest hashtag#sales tool we have to combat all things artificial!Most wonâ€™t change â€” they'll stay stuck and get replaced.And if this hits a nerve â€” good â€” it should and is absolutely intended!hashtag#AdaptOrDie",
