  "content": "Most AI models are trained on data, but what if they're missing the point? ü§îIn a world obsessed with data, we tried something different. We trained our AI on real conversations to gain insights that numbers alone can't provide.Why does this matter? Here's what we discovered:1. üéØ Context is King Unlike structured data, real dialogue captures nuances and intentions. This isn't just about what was said, but how it was said.2. üó£Ô∏è Emotions Tell Stories Data doesn't have a heartbeat. Conversations highlight the emotion behind decisions‚Äîan essential component in understanding user intent.3. üí° Real-World Relevance By learning from live interactions, our AI became more adaptable to current trends‚Äîsomething historical data fails to achieve dynamically.Common Misconception üö´: Many believe that more data equals better insights. Our experience taught us that richer context often trumps sheer volume.Challenge ‚ùì: Are you relying too heavily on data without considering the invaluable insights from real human interaction?Let's redefine the way we think about AI training.
