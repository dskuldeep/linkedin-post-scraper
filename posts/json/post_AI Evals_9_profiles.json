The next leap? Tying evaluation directly to business outcomes‚Äîsomething we're seeing more enterprises demand.Appreciate this clear, actionable post.Checkout LLUMO AI Newsletter-Subscribe on LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/build-relation/newsletter-follow?entityUrn=7264618895892758528\n\n                    ",
