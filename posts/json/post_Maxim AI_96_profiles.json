The way you broke down AI proficiency as a real, evolving skill, not just prompting tricks, was spot on.Quick side note from someone who has been heavily inspired by your blog writing style and learned so much from you, honestly, from A to Z. I noticed that when I click on the internal links in your blog, they open in the same tab.When I started publishing blogs for my contract manufacturing global business (thanks to your guidance), I made a conscious choice to have internal links open in a new tab. The goal was to reduce bounce rate and keep readers anchored to the original article.Just curious if there's a specific reason behind your approach. Would love to hear your thought process on this, too.Thanks again for constantly sharing such actionable insights ðŸ™Œ\n\n                    ",

Opening internal links in new tabs is generally not recommended from a UX and accessibilityÂ standpoint. It can disrupt the user's flow and may negatively impact accessibility for some users.Â Hope this helps!\n\n                    ",
