It will be led by communicators. ‚Äî Mustafa Suleyman didn‚Äôt say it like that, but he might as well have.As I reflect on his powerful conversation with Conor Grennan, one truth becomes crystal clear:üî∫ Emotional Intelligence (EQ) is becoming more valuable than prompt engineering. üî∫ The best AI collaborators won‚Äôt be those who shout instructions‚Äîbut those who build rapport.Why? Because Companion AIs are coming. Not just tools. They listen. They adapt. They grow with you. They‚Äôll know when to pause. When to affirm. When to nudge you toward better choices‚Äîprofessionally or personally.And they‚Äôll respond to context, tone, and human nuance.üõ† Work AI will still automate tasks. üí¨ But Companion AI? It‚Äôll need to mirror our humanity‚Ä¶ and sometimes, disagree with us constructively.This is a wake-up call for:TeachersLeadersParentsWritersCoachesAnyone who's ever thought ‚ÄúAI isn‚Äôt for me‚Äùüí• EQ is the new UX. üí• Conversation is the new coding. üí• Personality engineering is not science fiction‚Äîit‚Äôs happening.üéØ As a TVET Digitalisation Ambassador, I urge the sector to prepare not just for AI‚Äîbut with AI that understands people, not just protocols.The future belongs to those who can co-create with their tools.Let‚Äôs raise a new generation that can do both. Code with their head. Connect with their heart.üîä Your thoughts? Do you believe soft skills will define the next AI era? üëá Let‚Äôs debate in the comments.hashtag#AI hashtag#EmotionalIntelligence hashtag#TVET hashtag#Leadership hashtag#Education4IR hashtag#MustafaSuleyman hashtag#Copilot hashtag#DigitalCompanion hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#AIRevolution hashtag#DigitalTransformation hashtag#SoftSkills hashtag#EQ hashtag#DigitalLiteracy hashtag#AIinEducation",
