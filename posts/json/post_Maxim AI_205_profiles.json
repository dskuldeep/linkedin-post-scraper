I use LLMs to flesh out my own thinking, but have to constantly push AI to not promote/ encourage my own confirmation bias. It would be interesting to know how much of that data that is being created, is not information, and if it is, how much is redundant. AI isn‚Äôt really creating very much new imformation. Its just summarizing and regurgitating information humans have already created.How many petabytes of data in storage is just the result of all the em dashes created by LLMs?\n\n                    ",
