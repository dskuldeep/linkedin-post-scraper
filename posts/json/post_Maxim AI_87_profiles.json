  "content": "Over the last few weeks, I’ve had more conversations than ever about AI.Some businesses are excited but unsure where to begin. Others worry they’ll fall behind. And many are hesitant to take the plunge because they don’t want to invest in something that could be irrelevant in six months...and I get it! The speed of AI innovation - from action figure trends to the latest o3 and o4 mini releases - is exciting and overwhelming.But here’s the truth: you don’t need to have it all figured out to get started.The key is building AI solutions that are scalable, adaptable, and rooted in your actual business needs - not just hype. That’s where we come in. We help organisations take a confident first step with AI, without the pressure to predict the future.If you’re exploring what AI could look like in your world, I’m happy to share how others approach it and what’s working.hashtag#AI hashtag#BusinessStrategy hashtag#DigitalInnovation hashtag#ScalableSolutions hashtag#FutureReady hashtag#Scorchsoft",
