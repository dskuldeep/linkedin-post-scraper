  "content": "ðŸš€ AI in 2025: It's Not Just About Language, It's About ActionI recently came across an insightful take by Srikanth Velamakanni, co-founder of Fractal, in his interview with LinkedIn News India. He challenges the current narrative around Indian AI models â€” especially the heavy focus on building Indian language models or embedding cultural values â€” calling it a distraction.He puts it simply: \"The real issue of building foundation models is not about language capability, but about knowledge and action in the real world.\"This perspective really struck a chord with me. As someone exploring the intersection of AI and impact, I believe the real value lies in building systems that can reason, adapt, and act â€” not just process language, but drive meaningful outcomes.According to Deloitteâ€™s Tech Trends â€“ India Perspective 2025 report, Indian businesses are already moving in this direction, adopting small, multimodal models to deliver faster, targeted solutions. Itâ€™s exciting to see this shift.ðŸ’¡ My take? One AI trend that I believe will shape 2025 is the rise of actionable intelligence through agent-based AI â€” models that can plan, reason, and autonomously act in dynamic environments. Not just chat â€” but solve, adapt, and execute.What do you think? Whatâ€™s one AI trend you think will define 2025?hashtag#AI hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#TechTrends2025 hashtag#FoundationModels hashtag#MultimodalAI hashtag#Fractal hashtag#SrikanthVelamakanni hashtag#LinkedInNews hashtag#AITech hashtag#IndiaAI hashtag#AgentAI hashtag#FutureOfAI",

The next leap? Tying evaluation directly to business outcomesâ€”something we're seeing more enterprises demand.Appreciate this clear, actionable post.Checkout LLUMO AI Newsletter-Subscribe on LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/build-relation/newsletter-follow?entityUrn=7264618895892758528\n\n                    ",
