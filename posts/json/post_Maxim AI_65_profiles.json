  "content": "AI is booming — $600B+ today, on track to hit $1.8T by 2030. The possibilities? Huge.And yes, every time I correct ChatGPT, it responds like I’ve just uncovered a hidden truth of the universe. Nothing like getting a polite “You’re absolutely right!” to feel like I’m winning a gold star in a very supportive robot classroom.Just came across these AI stats — and honestly, who doesn’t love a good number? Stats make everything sound smarter… even when you’re still secretly googling “machine learning explained like I’m five.”As a new learner in the world of AI, I’m discovering something new every day. But as I go deeper into this journey, I’m especially curious about the how — not just hearing “we’re doing AI.” •\tHow are leaders embedding AI into business strategy (beyond the buzz)? •\tHow are they navigating culture change? •\tHow are people, process, and purpose aligning to create real value?If you’re leading or supporting a major AI initiative, I’d love to hear how it’s really going — what’s working, what’s not, and what you’ve learned.https://lnkd.in/eA9p4sWkhashtag#AI hashtag#AIbuzz hashtag#ChangeLeadership hashtag#DigitalTransformation hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#OrganisationalChange hashtag#BusinessStrategy hashtag#PeopleAndTech hashtag#ChatGPT",
