You have my attention. ðŸ‘€This week's buzz around Patrick Opet's open letter isn't just tech chatter; it's a critical spotlight on the escalating risks as AI agents become more autonomous. As IBM's Nataraj Nagaratnam points out, our security measures must evolve to match these innovations.Shobhit Varshney hits the nail on the head: 2025 might be the \"year of the agent,\" but it absolutely needs to be the \"year of governance.\" The sheer volume of SaaS vendors that many enterprises juggle makes robust security feel like navigating a minefield blindfolded.At Data Sentry MSP, we're not just observing this shift; we're building the guardrails. Secure by Design principles, standardized controls, and stronger third-party governance aren't just buzzwords â€“ they're the bedrock of a resilient AI-powered future.Let's make sure this \"year of the agent\" doesn't become the \"year of the breach.\" What are your thoughts on the biggest security challenges in the enterprise AI landscape? Let's discuss! hashtag#EnterpriseAI hashtag#AISecurity hashtag#Cybersecurity hashtag#DataGovernance hashtag#SoftwareSecurity hashtag#DataSentryMSP",
