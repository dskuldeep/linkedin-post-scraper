  "content": "\"Help your pieces so they can help you.\" - Paul MorphyYou can think of AI like a first-time chess player - it needs your guidance to make the right moves. Just like Morphy (one of the true üêê chess masters from the 1850s whose games are still studied today) knew, you need to have your foundations in place you want to win.How? Provide the AI the openings, the fundamentals, and the underlying strategy by sharing your story, your vision, and your intention. And remember, you always control the endgame - not the AI. When you bring yourself to the table and work together with your pieces, you help AI make the right moves for you, your clients and your customers.Check out this deep-dive from SmythOS on human-AI collaboration. From healthcare to creative arts, it shows that when you guide AI with purpose, you'll see your game transform.https://lnkd.in/g6bH64Uahashtag#AI hashtag#SmythOS hashtag#Innovation hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#AIStrategy hashtag#TechLeadership hashtag#DigitalTransformation hashtag#Chess",
