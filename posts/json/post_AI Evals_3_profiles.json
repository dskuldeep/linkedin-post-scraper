You need to know Eval.--Eval Series Part 2--🔍 What is Eval, really?Eval (short for evaluation) is how you measure whether your AI is doing what it’s supposed to do inside your product.It moves beyond model accuracy (like precision/recall) to ask:“𝘋𝘰𝘦𝘴 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘈𝘐 𝘢𝘤𝘵𝘶𝘢𝘭𝘭𝘺 𝘥𝘦𝘭𝘪𝘷𝘦𝘳 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘦𝘹𝘱𝘦𝘳𝘪𝘦𝘯𝘤𝘦 𝘰𝘳 𝘰𝘶𝘵𝘤𝘰𝘮𝘦 𝘮𝘺 𝘶𝘴𝘦𝘳𝘴 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘣𝘶𝘴𝘪𝘯𝘦𝘴𝘴 𝘯𝘦𝘦𝘥?”📐 Eval Methods to Know1.  Offline Eval – Run your AI on static prompts, compare against the expected output2. Human Eval – People rate quality: Is it fluent, helpful, right?3. Behavioral Eval – Throw curveballs: adversarial prompts, edge cases4. Automated Eval – Use AI to judge AI (e.g. LLM-as-a-judge)5. Live/Online Eval – Real user data: click-throughs, dwell time, completion🤷‍♀️ Why PMs Should Care→  It defines what “good enough” means so you’re not flying blind→  It catches model risks early, e.g. drift, bias, hallucinations→  It keeps the team focused on outcomes, not just tech magicIf you’re working with AI, Eval isn’t extra.Just like you wouldn’t ship code without testing, don’t ship AI without eval.👇 Comment below on the eval you have used hashtag#eval hashtag#aievaluation hashtag#productmanagement hashtag#aiproduct hashtag#aiPM hashtag#aiproductmanagement",
