Multilingual NLP models are the key.Grassroots Data, Ethically Collected 📊 AI is only as good as its data. We need datasets that represent rural, semi-urban, and tier-2/3 cities—built with privacy and consent in mind.Solve Real Bharat Problems 💡 AI for: ✅ Agriculture forecasting ✅ Education access in local languages ✅ Rural healthcare diagnostics ✅ Citizen service automation in local bodies Let’s stop copying Silicon Valley and start solving for Sabka Vikas.Affordable, Edge-first Tech 📱 Not everyone has 5G. AI needs to run on low-bandwidth, low-power devices. Think offline-first, lightweight models, and frugal innovation.Public + Private Partnerships 🤝 Government-led initiatives (like IndiaAI) must work with startups, academia & industry to scale AI in sectors like governance, education, and public health.🌱 Let’s build AI that’s not just made in India, but made for India.hashtag#AIForIndia hashtag#DigitalIndia hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#TechForGood hashtag#AI hashtag#IndiaTech hashtag#DigitalBharat",
