Carefully thought out AI setups that provide value and can be audited. Hence I believe we will see this everywhere. But there is still so much change management in the entire consumer game to be managed, and also in how it will be applied decentrally into more disparate processes. And we really need to think about how we add humans on top, and why they still matter even with AI doing the boring productivity work.",
