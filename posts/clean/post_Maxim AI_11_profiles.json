  "content": "Everyone Wants AI‚Ä¶ But Few Know What For ü§ñLately, almost every new client I talk to about web or mobile app development says: üëâ ‚ÄúWe want to add AI.‚ÄùIt‚Äôs exciting, no doubt. AI is transforming industries.But when I ask, ‚ÄúGreat! What exactly do you want the AI to do?‚Äù ‚Äî most clients pause.Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve realized: üí° AI has become a buzzword. Everyone feels they need it to stay ahead ‚Äî but many don‚Äôt yet know how it fits into their product strategy.As developers and tech partners, our role is changing. We‚Äôre not just coding apps anymore ‚Äî we‚Äôre helping clients translate business problems into smart, usable solutions. Sometimes that‚Äôs AI. Sometimes it‚Äôs not.Instead of starting with \"let's use AI\", I encourage clients to start with questions like: ‚úî What user experience are you trying to enhance? ‚úî What decisions do you want the app to make or assist with? ‚úî Are there repetitive tasks that could be automated? ‚úî Do you want to understand user behavior better? ‚úî Is real-time prediction or personalization important to your product?From there, AI may come into play in different forms:ü§ñ A chatbot to reduce support loadüß† Personalized recommendations based on user habitsüó£ Voice interactions for hands-free convenienceüì∑ Image recognition for document scanning, inventory, etc.üìä Predictive analytics for smarter user engagementBut in many cases, what clients actually need can be solved with a simple rule-based engine or a good UX flow ‚Äî not always full-blown machine learning.The bottom line: üîç AI is a powerful tool ‚Äî but it should be the solution to a clear problem, not just a feature to ‚Äútick a box.‚ÄùIf you‚Äôre planning to add AI to your app, I‚Äôd love to help you explore what that means practically ‚Äî and whether it's really AI you need‚Ä¶ or just better design thinking.What are others seeing? Are AI requests becoming the default in your projects too?hashtag#AI hashtag#ProductDevelopment hashtag#AppDesign hashtag#TechForFounders hashtag#StartupTips hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#Chatbot hashtag#MobileApps hashtag#UXDesign hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#Innovation",
