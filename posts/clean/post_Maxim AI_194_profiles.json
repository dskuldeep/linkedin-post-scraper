  "content": "üí° AI Readiness Isn‚Äôt About Data... It‚Äôs About Solving Business ProblemsWhen I work with companies planning their AI journey, one pattern always stands out:Many leaders obsess about whether their data is good enough.But the first, bigger question should be:\"Are we crystal clear on the business problem we are trying to solve?\"AI is not magic dust you sprinkle on messy operations. It‚Äôs a tool, and like any tool, it works best when the goal is clear.When we start AI projects with a clear business win (like \"reduce churn in premium customer segment by 10%\" or \"shorten support resolution time by 15%\"), success rates skyrocket.üëâüèª Technology follows the problem ‚Äî not the other way around.I'm curious what's the #1 business goal you'd love to solve with AI right now? üëáüèªhashtag#AI hashtag#DigitalTransformation hashtag#FractionalCTO hashtag#BusinessStrategy hashtag#AIDrivenBusiness",
