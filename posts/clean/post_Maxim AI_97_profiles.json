Let that sink in.🤯 We’re watching lines of code turn into lines of thought and AI is writing both.But here’s what keeps me up at night:👉 What happens when AI knows your tech stack better than you? 👉 When your “10x dev” is actually a prompt engineer? 👉 When shipping fast doesn’t mean working harder but asking better questions?It’s exciting. It’s terrifying. It’s happening.🔍 Will we evolve with it… or be replaced by it? 🔧 Will our roles become strategists, architects, prompt engineers? 🤝 Or are we underestimating the power of human intuition in building real-world solutions?Tech isn’t just changing it’s being rewritten. Not just by us. But with us. And sometimes… without us.💬 I’d love to hear what you think: Are we witnessing the golden age of innovation or the beginning of automation’s takeover?hashtag#TechFuture hashtag#AIinTech hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#AI hashtag#PromptEngineering hashtag#HumansVsMachines",
